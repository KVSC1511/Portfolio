## 📦 Getting Started: Developer Instructions

To get a local copy of the project up and running for development or contribution, follow these steps:

### **Prerequisites**

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn/pnpm/bun) installed on your machine.

*   **Node.js**: [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### **Installation**

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KVSC1511/My-Personal-Portfolio.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd My-Personal-Portfolio
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    Use your preferred package manager:

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    # or
    # pnpm install
    # or
    # bun install
    ```

### **Running the Development Server**

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
# yarn dev
# or
# pnpm dev
# or
# bun dev
```

Open your web browser and visit the address displayed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`). Vite provides Hot Module Replacement (HMR), so changes you make to the code will update in the browser instantly without a full page reload.

*(Note: This `localhost` URL is only accessible on your machine. For public access, please refer to the live site link or deployment instructions.)*

### **Building for Production**

To create an optimized production build of the application:

```bash
npm run build
# or
# yarn build
# or
# pnpm build
# or
# bun build
```

This command compiles and minifies the code into the `dist` folder, ready for deployment.

### **Previewing the Production Build**

You can locally preview the production build to ensure everything works as expected before deploying:

```bash
npm run preview
# or
# yarn preview
# or
# pnpm preview
# or
# bun preview
```

This will start a local server serving the files from the `dist` folder.

## 📝 Customization Guide

Personalizing this portfolio template is straightforward. Here's how you can make it your own:

*   **Replace Profile Images**:
    *   Locate your profile images in `public/images/profile.JPG` and potentially `assets/images/Thumbnail.jpg`.
    *   Replace these files with your own images, keeping the same file names or updating the paths in `src/App.jsx` and `README.md` accordingly.
*   **Update Social Media URLs**:
    *   Open `src/App.jsx`.
    *   Find the `social-icons` section and update the `href` attributes of the `<a>` tags with your own LinkedIn and email links.
*   **Edit Experience and Projects**:
    *   The content for the "About", "Education", "Experience", and "Projects" sections is primarily managed within the `src/App.jsx` file.
    *   Edit the text, dates, descriptions, and tech stacks within the respective sections to reflect your own information and achievements. The structure uses React components and standard JSX, making it easy to update.
*   **Configure EmailJS**:
    *   Open `src/components/Contact.jsx`.
    *   You will need to sign up for a free account on [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/).
    *   Replace the placeholder public key (`hkNKS0EUbuFnA2a5j` in the `emailjs.init()` call) with your actual EmailJS public key.
    *   Configure your EmailJS service, template, and account to receive emails.
*   **Customize Tailwind Styles**:
    *   Tailwind CSS is used for all styling. You can customize the theme (colors, fonts, spacing, etc.) by editing `tailwind.config.js`.
    *   Modify existing utility classes in your JSX files (`.text-xl`, `.mb-4`, etc.) or add new custom CSS in `src/index.css` using Tailwind's `@apply` directive if needed.
